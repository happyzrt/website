03:01.060 --> 03:04.050
说到我们夺回七大王国之后
About all the things we would do to that man...

03:05.570 --> 03:07.300
这个人落入我们手中时
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms

03:07.340 --> 03:08.800
处置他的种种方式
and had him in our grasp.

03:11.130 --> 03:14.170

03:15.720 --> 03:17.510
我可没看见什么军队
I don't see an army.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.300
我只看到一个人 还只有一只手
I see one man, with one hand.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.340
看来你姐姐骗了我
It appears your sister lied to me.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.140
她也骗了我
She lied to me as well.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.470
她从未想过派兵北上
She never had any intention of sending her army north.

03:33.510 --> 03:37.470
她有了攸伦·葛雷乔伊的舰队和两万名精兵

他独自北上 很清楚会受到怎样的对待
He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received.

04:04.060 --> 04:07.130
如果他刚才说的不是实情 那他还何必如此？
Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

04:07.750 --> 04:10.580
大概是相信在他割破我的喉咙前
Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him,

04:10.590 --> 04:13.590
弟弟会一直为自己辩护吧
right up to the moment he slits my throat.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.800

the same as he did yours.

Do you want me to apologize?

But I know Ser Jaime.

05:07.950 --> 05:09.510
他是个有荣誉感的人
He is a man of honor.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.420
我曾俘虏过他
I was his captor once.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.340
但是后来我们遭到绑架
But when we were both taken prisoner

05:14.340 --> 05:17.130
当那帮人企图强奸我的时候
and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me,

05:17.390 --> 05:18.720
詹姆爵士保护了我
Ser Jaime defended me.

05:20.140 --> 05:22.380

派我去追踪您的下落 带您回家
and sent me to find you and bring you home

05:35.460 --> 05:38.380
因为他向您母亲发过誓
because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

05:44.650 --> 05:45.920
你在为他做担保？
You vouch for him?

05:48.980 --> 05:49.960
是的
I do.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.920
你会和他并肩作战么？
You would fight beside him?

06:00.790 --> 06:01.920

06:06.540 --> 06:08.210
我将性命托付于你
I trust you with my life.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.470
若你也敢托付给他
If you trust him with yours,

07:53.850 --> 07:55.420
如果你不能帮我夺回来
If you can't help me take it back,

07:55.510 --> 07:57.470
首相我就另找高明
I'll find another Hand who can.

07:57.790 --> 08:00.250
<b>乔拉·莫尔蒙
</b>女王铁卫 “大熊”

08:02.700 --> 08:04.760
估计战事结束前 这首相徽章的主人
I suspect one of you will be wearing this

08:05.690 --> 08:06.920
就要从你俩当中选了
before it's all over.

08:15.510 --> 08:18.680
<b>詹德利
</b>劳勃国王的私生子 “大牛”

08:45.960 --> 08:48.460
<b>艾莉亚·史塔克</b>

09:00.680 --> 09:02.300
你就没别的事可干了么？
Don't you have something better to do?

09:02.580 --> 09:04.670
我的武器你做好没？
You make my weapon yet?

09:04.760 --> 09:08.760
等我弄完手头几千把这玩意儿就动手
Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.380
你应该先给我造
You should make mine first.

09:10.590 --> 09:12.510
还要确保比这个再结实点
And make sure it's stronger than this.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.170
够结实了吧
It's strong enough.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.510
你知道吧 下到墓窖里会更安全的
It's going to be safer down in the crypt,you know.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.880
你要去墓窖么？
Are you going to be down in the crypt?

09:26.030 --> 09:28.090
- 不去 但 - 但你是个战士
- No, but... - But you're a fighter.

09:29.350 --> 09:30.530
我打的尸鬼够多了
I've done my share.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.010
你和尸鬼战斗过？
You've fought them?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.170
嗯 打过一些吧
I did. Some of them.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.510
有多少？
How many?

09:38.670 --> 09:39.780
没多少
A few.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.360
对我而言也挺多了
That was enough.

09:45.130 --> 09:46.760
它们什么样啊？
What are they like?

09:47.850 --> 09:48.800
可怕
Bad.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.420
非常可怕
Really bad.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.430
“非常可怕”？
"Really bad"?

09:56.020 --> 09:59.510
即便是铁匠学徒 也该能形容得比“非常可怕”形象一点吧
Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad."

09:59.950 --> 10:02.020
它们到底长什么样？身上什么味道？
What do they look like? What do they smell like?

10:02.020 --> 10:04.090
怎么行动？彻底弄死它们有多难？
How do they move? How hard are they to kill?

10:04.170 --> 10:05.760
听好 我知道你想战斗
Look, I know you want to fight.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.170
知道你不怕什么强奸犯 杀人狂……
And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or...

10:09.410 --> 10:11.010
但这次不一样 这次…
This is different. This is...

10:12.010 --> 10:13.380
这次是死亡
This is death.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.550
你想知道它们什么样？死亡的样子
You want to know what they're like? Death.

10:15.630 --> 10:17.570
死亡 死神 反正就是那副模样
That's what they're like.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.630
我见识过死神
I know Death.

10:29.510 --> 10:30.620
他有千张面孔
He's got many faces.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.960
很期待见见他这一张脸呢
I look forward to seeing this one.

10:43.770 --> 10:46.210
- 姐的武器呢？- 这就动手
- My weapon? - I'll get right on it.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.590
我很抱歉把你推下塔楼
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.960
你当初并无歉意
You weren't sorry then.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.720
你在维护自己的家人
You were protecting your family.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.170
我已经不是那样的人了
I'm not that person anymore.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.670
如果不是你当初把我推下去
You still would be,

11:36.940 --> 11:39.470
你现在依旧是那样的人
if you hadn't pushed me out of that window.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.210
而我可能还是布兰登·史塔克
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.960
- 你现在不是么？- 不是了
- You're not? - No.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.300
我现在是另一种存在
I'm something else now.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.260
你不怪我
You're not angry at me.

11:52.460 --> 11:53.840
我不怪任何人
I'm not angry at anyone.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.920
你为什么没告诉他们？
Why didn't you tell them?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.880
如果我让他们先杀了你
You won't be able to help us in this fight

11:58.880 --> 12:01.100
你就不能在这场大战中助我们一臂之力了
if I let them murder you first.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.010
那大战之后呢？
What about afterwards?

12:07.390 --> 12:10.170
你怎么知道我们能活到大战之后？
How do you know there is an afterwards?

12:27.920 --> 12:30.300
在地上做个记号！
Put a marker in the ground!

12:31.630 --> 12:33.920
把它送到城墙上去
Bring it up to the wall!

12:34.010 --> 12:35.840
好的 送到城墙上去
Up to the wall. All right.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.340
得 我们都到这儿来了
Well, here we are.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.220
是呀 我们都到这儿来了
Yes, here we are.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.720
又在一起了
Together again.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.960
群众还挺喜闻乐见
And the masses rejoice.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.880
他们怎么看待他们的新女王？
How do they feel about their new queen?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.510
她也是你的新女王
She's your new queen too.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.310
他们记得上次坦格利安家族
They remember what happened

13:00.310 --> 13:02.740
带着龙北上时 发生过什么
the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.

13:03.710 --> 13:04.660
一旦他们发现
They'll come around

13:04.660 --> 13:06.480
丹妮莉丝与她的祖先不一样 他们会回心转意的
once they see Daenerys is different.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.880
那她真的是吗？不一样？
And she is? Different?

13:09.070 --> 13:10.260
她不一样
She is.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.510
- 你这么相信她？- 是的
- You're sure about her? - I am.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.090
她似乎没有那么相信你
She didn't seem sure about you.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.090
这不怪她
It's hard to blame her.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.400
我犯了一个聪明人常犯的错误
I made a mistake common to clever people.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.170
- 我低估了我的对手 - 嗯
- I underestimated my opponents. - Hmm.

13:22.690 --> 13:25.510
瑟曦告诉我这次怀孕改变了她
Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.690
她说这是一个让你们俩都重新开始的契机
A chance for you both to start again.

13:27.690 --> 13:28.840
而我相信了她
And I believed her.

13:31.490 --> 13:33.340
怀孕这事也是她捏造的吗？
Was she lying about the baby too?

13:35.010 --> 13:37.010
不 那个倒是真的
No, that part is real.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.010
她一直很擅长利用事实来编造谎话
She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.

13:44.510 --> 13:45.920
不用太自责
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.880
我被她骗得最苦
She's fooled me more than anybody.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.630
怎么了？
What?

13:52.250 --> 13:54.130
你从来没被她骗过
She never fooled you.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.880
你一直都很清楚她是怎样的人
You always knew exactly what she was,

13:57.060 --> 13:58.380
但你依然爱她
and you loved her anyway.

14:09.880 --> 14:10.920
看来……
So...

14:12.230 --> 14:15.590
……我们要死在临冬城了
...we're going to die at Winterfell.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.590
这不是我原本计划的死法
Not the death I would've chosen.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.430
我一直想象我80岁的时候
I always pictured myself

14:22.430 --> 14:24.260
躺在自己床上
dying in my own bed,

14:24.480 --> 14:25.720
行将就木
the age of 80,

14:26.360 --> 14:28.420
- 喝饱了酒 还有 - ……一个姑娘
- with a belly full of wine and -  ...a girl's mouth

14:28.420 --> 14:30.760
- 帮你吹箫 - 帮我吹箫
- around your cock. - around my cock.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.430
至少瑟曦无法亲手杀死我
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.800
当我正被尸鬼撕碎的时候
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction

14:39.800 --> 14:41.260
想到剥夺了她这一乐趣
denying her that pleasure

14:41.490 --> 14:44.340
肯定会感到某种满足
while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.420
或许等我死了以后……
Maybe after I'm dead...

14:50.650 --> 14:52.260
我会南下进军君临城
I'll march down to King's Landing

14:52.340 --> 14:53.630
然后撕碎瑟曦
and rip her apart.

15:24.940 --> 15:28.110
<b>波德瑞克·派恩
</b>布蕾妮的侍从

15:25.340 --> 15:27.510
很好 对 瞄准
Good. Yes, aim.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.090
别急
Don't rush.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.170
上前来
Come forward.

15:35.090 --> 15:36.910
- 来呀 - 詹姆爵士
- Come on. - Ser Jaime.

15:37.010 --> 15:38.670
布蕾妮小姐
Lady Brienne.

15:46.290 --> 15:49.720
- 他进步很大 - 凑合吧
- He's come a long way. - He's all right.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.050
再来一次 快点
One more time. Come on.

15:51.190 --> 15:54.720
- 需要学习的还很多 - 你肯定会教他的
- Still has a lot to learn. - I'm sure you'll teach him.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.220
我听说你将指挥左翼部队
I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.670
是的
I am.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.510
这个 呃……地形不错
It's, uh... It's good ground.

16:02.590 --> 16:03.680
是的
It is.

16:04.410 --> 16:07.450
那个斜坡 会对我们有利
The rise, it should give us some advantage.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.760
如果能保持紧密的队形
If we can keep a tight formation,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.560
我们或许有机会击退他们
we might be able to beat them back.

16:11.060 --> 16:13.130
是 你说得对
Yes, I think you're right.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.960
- 你怎么回事？ - 什么？
- What are you doing? - What?

16:15.090 --> 16:18.020
- 我想你应该知道 - 我真的不知道
- I think you know. - I truly don't.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.050
我们从来没有哪次交谈 这么半天了
We have never had a conversation last this long

16:20.050 --> 16:22.060
你都没侮辱我 一次也没有
without you insulting me. Not once.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.140
你希望我侮辱你？
You want me to insult you?

16:23.140 --> 16:24.600
- 当然不！- 那不就好了
- No! - Good.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.210
我到临冬城是因为……
I came to Winterfell because...

16:38.520 --> 16:40.680
虽然我不是从前那个战士了
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.970
但是能在你的指挥下战斗 我会倍感荣耀
But I'd be honored to serve under your command,

16:44.980 --> 16:46.260
如果你愿意接纳我的话
if you'll have me.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.050
我得回去了
I better get back.

17:18.220 --> 17:19.590
抱歉 卡丽熙
Forgive me, khaleesi.

17:22.030 --> 17:24.340
你做了什么冒犯我的事吗？
Have you done something to offend me?

17:24.510 --> 17:25.680
很多
Many things.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.920
那都是很久以前的事了 而且我早就原谅你了
Long ago and long forgiven.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.550
但就算我犯下过失
But you did forgive,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.090
你仍然原谅了我
despite my failures.

17:34.890 --> 17:38.010
当我听说你任命了提利昂为御前首相
When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.210
我的心都碎了
it broke my heart.

17:41.410 --> 17:42.760
我任命他为首相的时候
When I named him Hand,

17:42.760 --> 17:45.880
并不知道我能否再见到你
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.840
你做出了正确的选择
You made the right choice.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.720
在我的印象中 你不是很喜欢他
I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.050
确实
I didn't.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.620
我们从瓦兰提斯到弥林那一路上
His mouth hardly stopped moving

17:53.620 --> 17:55.220
他一直喋喋不休
between Volantis and Meereen.

17:55.220 --> 17:57.840
我强忍着才没将他丢进海里
It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.510
但在那些油腔滑调背后 他的聪明才智……
But the mind behind all those words...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.720
他犯了错误
He's made mistakes.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.260
很严重的错误
Serious mistakes.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.380
我们都犯过错
As have we all.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.380
他有自己的过失
He owns his

18:17.470 --> 18:18.720
然后从中吸取教训
and learns from them.

18:20.010 --> 18:21.990
你在建议我宽恕
You're advising me to forgive the man

18:21.990 --> 18:23.610
那个抢占你位置的人？
who stole your position?

18:24.760 --> 18:25.840
是的
I am.

18:27.210 --> 18:29.010
如果您允许的话
And one other suggestion,

18:29.280 --> 18:31.420
我还有一个谏言
if you'll allow me.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.960
等到所有步兵都被调派到战场上
The moment we can get the last infantryman

18:34.050 --> 18:36.510
我们就应该马上关闭城门
out onto the field, we should shut the gates.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.670
尽你的全力让城门多开一会
Keep them open for as long as you can.

18:38.870 --> 18:41.670
还有人正从郊外逃难而来
There are still people coming in from the countryside.

18:41.890 --> 18:43.850
<b>约恩·罗伊斯
</b>“青铜” 谷地领主

18:47.400 --> 18:49.960
珊莎夫人 我希望我们可以私下谈谈
Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.010
我之前本以为
I thought you and I

19:09.010 --> 19:11.170
就快和你达成共识了
were on the verge of agreement before.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.260
关于詹姆爵士的问题
About Ser Jaime.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.800
布蕾妮一直对我很忠诚
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.130
她是我最信任的人
I trust her more than anyone.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.210
真希望我也能如此信任我的顾问
I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.470
提利昂是个好人
Tyrion is a good man.

19:26.850 --> 19:29.210
他对我一向彬彬有礼
He was never anything but decent towards me.

19:29.540 --> 19:33.340
我任命他为首相 不只因为他是个好人
I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.300
我任命他为我的首相
I asked him to be my Hand

19:35.800 --> 19:38.570
是因为他是个有头脑的好人
because he was good, and intelligent,

19:38.580 --> 19:40.760
而且必要时 他也会变得无情
and ruthless when he had to be.

19:42.290 --> 19:44.090
他一开始就不应该相信瑟曦
He never should have trusted Cersei.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.260
您也不应该相信她
You never should have either.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.470
我以为他了解他的姐姐
I thought he knew his sister.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.090
家家有本难念的经
Families are complicated.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.380
我的家族也是如此
Ours certainly have been.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.630
可悲的共同点
A sad thing to have in common.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.670
我们两个还有其他的共同点
We have other things in common.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.320
我们都知道作为女性领导者的艰难
We've both known what it means to lead people

20:10.320 --> 20:13.300
领导那些不愿意屈服于女人的人
who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.

20:13.510 --> 20:15.640
而且在我来看
And we've both done a damn good job of it,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.300
我们都做得很好
from what I can tell.

20:19.860 --> 20:24.590
尽管如此 我还是感受到了我们之间有些不睦
And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.840
为什么？
Why is that?

20:31.300 --> 20:32.260
因为你哥哥
Your brother.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.420
他爱您 您是知道的
He loves you, you know that.

20:39.090 --> 20:40.260
但是这点困扰着你
That bothers you.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.880
男人会为女人做蠢事
Men do stupid things for women.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.010
他们很容易受女人摆布
They're easily manipulated.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.880
我这一生只有一个目标：
All my life, I've known one goal:

20:52.120 --> 20:53.420
铁王座
the Iron Throne.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.720
我要把它从毁掉我家族的敌人手里夺回来
Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family,

20:57.720 --> 20:59.510
这个敌人也几乎毁掉你的家族
and almost destroyed yours.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.630
我只与他们为敌
My war was against them.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.300
直到我遇到了琼恩
Until I met Jon.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.050
如今我在这里 在半个世界之外
Now I'm here, half a world away,

21:10.200 --> 21:12.890
在琼恩的战争中与他并肩作战
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

21:13.290 --> 21:15.840
你来告诉我 到底是谁受谁的摆布？
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

21:23.690 --> 21:27.630
你当初一抵达临冬城时我就应该向您表示感谢
I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.340
这是我的错
That was a mistake.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.300
我来这里 是因为我爱上了你哥哥……
I'm here because I love your brother...

21:37.020 --> 21:38.540
因为我相信他……
and I trust him...

21:39.290 --> 21:42.300
还因为我知道他是个恪守承诺的人
and I know he's true to his word.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.230
在我生命中 他是仅有的第二个
He's only the second man in my life

21:44.230 --> 21:46.030
能让我这么评价的男人
I can say that about.

21:47.550 --> 21:48.800
第一个是谁？
Who was the first?

21:49.230 --> 21:50.720
某个比他高点儿的人
Someone taller.

21:56.030 --> 21:58.170
那么之后呢？
And what happens afterwards?

21:59.800 --> 22:03.090
当我们消灭了尸鬼大军 打败了瑟曦
We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.720
之后呢？
What happens then?

22:07.340 --> 22:08.880
我夺回铁王座
I take the Iron Throne.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.090
那么北境呢？
What about the North?

22:14.450 --> 22:16.300
敌人从我们手中夺走北境
It was taken from us,

22:16.880 --> 22:18.550
我们又亲手将它夺回
and we took it back.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.800
我们也曾说过 北境永远不再向任何人俯首称臣
And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.470
到时候 您将如何处置北境？
What about the North?

22:31.010 --> 22:33.670
抱歉打扰了  夫人 陛下……
Apologies, my lady.Your Grace...

22:34.140 --> 22:35.420

My queen.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.300
你姐姐呢？
Your sister?

23:01.370 --> 23:02.510
她只剩下了几艘船
She only has a few ships,

23:02.510 --> 23:03.960
也没法把船开来这里
and she couldn't sail them here.

23:04.090 --> 23:07.010
所以她去了铁群岛
So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead,

23:07.160 --> 23:08.920
她将以您的名义夺回铁群岛
to take them back in your name.

23:09.010 --> 23:10.470
你为什么没有和她一起回去？
But why aren't you with her?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.590
我想为临冬城作战 珊莎公爵夫人……
I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa...

23:21.620 --> 23:23.040
如果您允许的话
if you'll have me.

23:53.630 --> 23:55.130

听着 我活了大半辈子
Look, I made it through most of my years

24:03.710 --> 24:05.340
连战场的边儿都没蹭到
without ever getting near a fight,

24:05.640 --> 24:07.800
但之后我却在私生子之战里活下来了
but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.410
就在那道城墙之外
Right outside these walls.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.880
既然我能从那儿活下来 你们也能活下去
If I can live through that,you can live through this.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.260
他们会在锻造处给你们武器和装备
They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.340
就在那边
Right that way.

24:20.170 --> 24:21.380
谢谢您
Thank you.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.820

When the time comes,you'll be down in the crypts.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.320

They're the safest place to be.

谢谢你
Thank you.

24:39.830 --> 24:41.450

Which way should I go?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.120

Which way do you want to go?

All the children will be going below

24:50.970 --> 24:53.130

when the time comes.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.720
但是我的两个哥哥曾经都是战士
But both me brothers were soldiers.

I want to fight too.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.300

- 我会感到更安全 - 很多人都会这样觉得
- to protect us.- I'm sure a lot of people would.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.390
好呀 那我就去保护墓窖里的人
All right.I'll defend the crypt, then.

我们在最后壁炉城碰面
We met up at the Last Hearth.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.510
但是尸鬼大军先我们一步
The dead got there first.

26:23.760 --> 26:24.880
安柏家的人呢？
The Umbers?

26:25.490 --> 26:26.960

我们得绕过他们才回到这里
We had to travel around them to get here.

现在还没到这儿的
Whoever's not here now

26:33.620 --> 26:34.670

is with them.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.590

How long do we have?

26:37.980 --> 26:40.380

We can't beat them in a straight fight.

27:22.230 --> 27:23.600

So, what can we do?

27:25.670 --> 27:28.590
它们都是被夜王转化的 听他的指挥
The Night King made them all.They follow his command.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.760

If that's true,he'll never expose himself.

他想抹去这个世界 而我是这个世界的记忆
He wants to erase this world,and I am its memory.

That's what death is,isn't it?

28:03.130 --> 28:04.260
忘记
Forgetting.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.210

他不是一个人 我会和他在一起
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

With the Ironborn.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.920

Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,

29:12.680 --> 29:14.420
给你们点燃战壕的信号
to give you the signal to light the trench.

戴佛斯爵士完全可以自己挥舞火把
Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.

29:18.260 --> 29:20.340
你就待在墓窖里
You'll be in the crypt.

陛下 我也曾参加过战斗
Your Grace, I have fought before,

29:22.580 --> 29:23.530
我可以再打一仗
I can do it again.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.220
与那些冒着生命危险的
Alongside the men and women

29:25.220 --> 29:26.230
男人和女人们一同战斗
risking their lives.

29:26.230 --> 29:27.760
他们有成千上万人
There are thousands of them

29:27.840 --> 29:29.420
可你只有一个
and only one of you.

29:29.740 --> 29:31.330
你不能像他们一样勇猛地战斗
You can't fight as well as they can,

29:31.330 --> 29:33.760
但你出谋划策比他们都厉害
but you can think better than any of them.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.260
你在这里正是因为你机智过人
You're here because of your mind.

29:36.450 --> 29:38.130
如果我们幸存下来 我还需要你的智慧
If we survive, I'll need it.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.920
在战场上 巨龙应该能给我们带来一些优势
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.550
如果巨龙在战场上 它们就没法保护布兰
If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.

29:47.810 --> 29:49.270
我们得离布兰近一点
We need to be near him.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.000
不能太近
Not too near,

29:50.000 --> 29:51.420
否则夜王就不会来了
or the Night King won't come.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.790
但要近到可以在夜王过来时追上他
But close enough to pursue him when he does.

29:53.830 --> 29:55.760
龙焰能够挡住夜王吗？
Dragonfire will stop him?

29:56.050 --> 29:57.550
我不知道
I don't know.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.210
从来没人尝试过
No one's ever tried.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.550
我们都要死了
We're all going to die.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.340
但至少我们会死在一起
But at least we die together.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.720

Let's get some rest.

30:26.510 --> 30:27.510

33:55.710 --> 33:57.070
我不止一次救过吉莉

33:57.070 --> 34:00.140
我从学城的图书馆里偷走过很多很多书
I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library,

34:00.140 --> 34:02.470
我还从先民拳峰活了下来
survived the Fist of the First Men.

34:02.830 --> 34:04.720
你们这里需要我
You need me out there.

34:05.030 --> 34:06.210
如果真到了这个地步
Well, if that's what it's come to,

34:06.210 --> 34:08.780
- 我们就真操蛋了 - 其实 说你被操蛋了
- we really are fucked. - Well, calling you "fucked"

34:08.780 --> 34:10.590
并不完全准确
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.050
山姆威尔·塔利
Samwell Tarly.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.720
异鬼杀手

34:18.980 --> 34:20.470
妇女之友
Lover of Ladies.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.600
这些征兆就足以表明
As if we needed any more signs

34:23.600 --> 34:24.910
这个世界要完蛋了
the world was ending.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.590
想当初
Think back to where we started.

34:31.130 --> 34:34.890
有我们大家 还有葛兰和派普
Us, Grenn, Pyp.

34:36.130 --> 34:38.510
如今只剩我们三个人了
Now it's just us three.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.260
最后一个活着的 记得烧了另外两个
Last man left, burn the rest of us.

34:58.170 --> 34:59.760
我真希望父亲也在这里
I wish Father were here.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.060
我很想看看他脸上的表情
I would love to see the look on his face

35:04.060 --> 35:05.760
当他意识到他的两个儿子
when he realizes his two sons

35:05.760 --> 35:08.010
都将为了保护临冬城而死去
are about to die defending Winterfell.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.630
那表情一定会很有趣
That would be something to see.

35:21.050 --> 35:24.010
我还记得我们第一次来这儿
I remember the first time we were here,

35:24.200 --> 35:25.920
我第一次看见这个大厅
the first time I saw this hall.

35:26.110 --> 35:26.920
嗯
Mm.

35:27.010 --> 35:28.550
你是头黄金雄狮
You were a golden lion.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.420
我是个醉醺醺的嫖客
I was a drunken whoremonger.

35:32.550 --> 35:33.940
一切都是那么简单
It was all so simple.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.860
远没有那么简单
It wasn't so simple.

35:37.410 --> 35:38.920
我还在和我姐姐上床
I was sleeping with my sister

35:38.920 --> 35:41.470
而你在这世上还只有一个朋友
and you had one friend in the world

35:41.800 --> 35:43.330
一个和他姐姐上床的朋友
who was sleeping with his sister.

35:43.420 --> 35:45.380
我是说比现在要简单一些
I was speaking in relative terms.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.840
- 你怀念那段时光吗？ - 我当然怀念了
- Do you miss it? - Of course I miss it.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.770
不过 对我来说 黄金雄狮的日子已经过去了
Well, my golden-lion days are done,

35:53.790 --> 35:56.800
而对你来说 和妓女鬼混的毛病也许还在
but whoremongering is still an option for you.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.380
不在了
It's not.

36:00.030 --> 36:02.760
正是因为我变得专情 才闹出那样的事
Things would be easier if it were.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.550
敬自我完善带来的危害
The perils of self-betterment.

36:13.970 --> 36:14.960
哦！
Oh!

36:15.390 --> 36:16.550

36:16.630 --> 36:18.690
哦 我们不是有意打扰
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

36:18.690 --> 36:20.670
我们只是找个暖和地方来……
We were just looking for somewhere warm to...

36:20.670 --> 36:22.550
思考即将到来的死亡
To contemplate your imminent death.

36:22.550 --> 36:24.470
那你可来对了地方
You've come to the right place.

36:24.670 --> 36:27.260
要来口马尿吗？味道还凑合
You want some of this piss? It's not bad.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.560
- 可也没多好 - 谢谢 大人
- It's not good either. - Thank you, milord.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.340
我觉得这不太明智
I don't think that's wise.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.920
战斗随时可能打响
The battle might start at any moment.

36:36.670 --> 36:37.800
只能半杯
Half cup.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.120
- 你呢？ - 不用 谢谢
- And you? - No, thank you.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.760
我应该试着睡会儿
I should try and get some sleep.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.650
你真觉得今晚有人睡得着吗
You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight?

36:47.860 --> 36:49.050
来一杯吧
Join us.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.170
行吧
All right.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.590
少来点儿
Just a bit.

37:00.550 --> 37:01.920
你们喝小酒呢
Well, what do we have here?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.230
戴佛斯爵士 你也来一杯吗
Ser Davos, join us.

37:03.230 --> 37:04.460
不 我不用了 谢谢
No, none for me, thanks.

37:04.460 --> 37:05.900
我就是图这把炉火
Came here for this.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.580
我想我在外边冻掉卵蛋也是等死
I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there

37:11.400 --> 37:14.010
在这里温暖舒适也是等死
or wait to die nice and warm in here.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.260
今晚可能是我们在人间的最后一夜了
It could be our last night in this world, you know.

37:21.730 --> 37:24.550
是啊 我很高兴你在这里
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.640

37:26.640 --> 37:28.590
很高兴你从东海望活着回来了
Glad you survived Eastwatch.

37:28.590 --> 37:30.170
来一杯吗
Would you like a drink?

37:31.130 --> 37:32.220
自备了
Brought my own.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.520
听说大家都叫你“杀君者”
They call you "King Killer."

37:42.530 --> 37:44.210
某些人是这么叫
I'm sure someone does.

37:45.310 --> 37:47.440
大家叫我“巨人克星”
They call me "Giantsbane."

37:48.670 --> 37:49.800
知道为什么吗
Want to know why?

38:00.520 --> 38:03.470
10岁那年我杀了一个巨人
I killed a giant when I was 10.

38:05.490 --> 38:09.090
然后爬上床跟他老婆一起睡
Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.630
你知道她醒来以后怎么做的吗
When she woke up, you know what she did?

38:17.200 --> 38:21.420
她给我喂了三个月的奶
Suckled me at her teat for three months.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.340
以为我是她的孩子
Thought I was her baby.

38:24.530 --> 38:26.550
所以我才这么强壮
That's how I got so strong.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.720
都是因为巨人的奶
Giant's milk.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.780
听得我也想喝一杯了
Maybe I will have that drink.

39:03.690 --> 39:06.570
<b>桑铎·克里冈
</b>“猎狗”


39:28.930 --> 39:30.080
你以前总说个不停
You never used to shut up.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.380
现在却像个哑巴一样坐在这儿
Now you're just sitting there like a mute.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.100
大概我变了吧
Guess I've changed.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.350
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing up here?

39:47.840 --> 39:49.300
你觉得我还能干嘛
What's it look like?

39:49.960 --> 39:52.630
不 我是问 你来这里做什么
No, I mean, what are you doing up here?

39:55.130 --> 39:56.670
你加入了兄弟会
You joined the Brotherhood.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.490
你和琼恩去了长城外
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.

39:58.490 --> 39:59.960
现在你又来了这儿 为什么？
You're here now. Why?

40:02.380 --> 40:05.250
你上次为别人而战是什么时候了？
When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?

40:08.160 --> 40:10.130
我曾为你而战 还记得吗
I fought for you, didn't I?

40:20.390 --> 40:21.960
靠 我操
Oh, for fuck's sake.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.550
这下他妈的还不如参加婚礼有意思
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

40:27.290 --> 40:28.390

My lady.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.380

40:37.330 --> 40:38.340
有一阵子在
For a little while.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.670
没关系
That's all right.

40:42.770 --> 40:45.470
光之王终究还是让我们相聚了
The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.070
此刻属于他
This is his moment.

40:49.810 --> 40:51.990
- 当光…… - 索罗斯都已经不在了
- When light... - Thoros isn't here anymore,

40:51.990 --> 40:53.920
劝你别再布道了
so I hope you're not about to give a sermon.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.380
如果你继续的话
Because if you are,

40:56.630 --> 40:59.420
光之王可能会后悔救回你19次
the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times

40:59.420 --> 41:02.310
难道他就为了看你被我扔到那破墙外头摔死吗
just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.090
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?

41:19.640 --> 41:23.480
我可不想跟你们两个可怜的老王八蛋一起度过最后时刻
I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.050
那是给我的吗？
That for me?

42:03.130 --> 42:04.760
这个还不错
This'll work.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.490
上次你见我的时候
Last time you saw me,

42:09.490 --> 42:11.310
你就想让我来临冬城
you wanted me to come to Winterfell.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.720
虽然绕了些远路 但我还是……
Took the long road, but...

42:15.610 --> 42:17.550
红袍女想要你做什么
What did the Red Woman want with you?

42:22.070 --> 42:25.510
她想用我的血做法术
She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.

42:25.590 --> 42:27.090
为什么是你的血
Why your blood?

42:28.920 --> 42:30.730
我是劳勃·拜拉席恩的私生子
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

42:32.230 --> 42:34.090
直到红袍女告诉我我才知道
I didn't know until she told me.

42:34.850 --> 42:36.480
然后她把我捆起来 扒光我的衣服
Then she tied me up, stripped me down,

42:36.480 --> 42:37.840
让水蛭爬满我全身
put leeches all over me.

42:41.330 --> 42:43.170
那是你的第一次吗
Was that your first time?

42:43.960 --> 42:45.830
不 好吧 是第一次有水蛭爬到我鸡巴上
No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.010
是你第一次睡女人吗
Your first time with a woman.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.120
你说什么？
What?

42:49.960 --> 42:52.720
我…… 我没有…… 我没跟她睡
I... I didn't... I wasn't with her.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.880
在君临呢 你睡过别的姑娘吗？
Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?

42:55.960 --> 42:57.630
离开君临以后呢？
Or after?

43:01.950 --> 43:03.040
你不记得了？
You don't remember?

43:05.380 --> 43:07.260
- 对 我睡过 - 一个？
- Yes, I was. - One?

43:08.520 --> 43:09.720
两个？
Two?

43:10.140 --> 43:12.640
- 还是二十个？- 好吧 我没数过
- Twenty? - Well, I didn't keep count.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.260
不 你数过
Yes, you did.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.170
三个
Three.

43:26.060 --> 43:28.340
我们可能很快就要死了
We're probably going to die soon.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.670
死之前我想知道那是什么感觉
I want to know what it's like before that happens.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.380
艾莉亚 我……
Arya, I...

44:17.510 --> 44:19.670
我不是红袍女
I'm not the Red Woman.

44:19.890 --> 44:21.420
你自己脱裤子吧
Take your own bloody pants off.

44:46.290 --> 44:48.420
这种感觉很奇怪 是不是
It's strange, isn't it?

44:51.050 --> 44:56.100
几乎在座所有人都曾经和史塔克家族打过仗
Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another.

44:56.670 --> 45:00.960
现在我们却都在史塔克家的城堡 准备并肩作战
And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it.

45:01.050 --> 45:02.260
保卫它
Together.

45:05.220 --> 45:07.090
至少我们死得光荣
At least we'll die with honor.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.680
我们也可能活下来
I think we might live.

45:18.170 --> 45:19.760

I... I do.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.130

45:51.730 --> 45:53.510
她居然不是爵士？
She's not a ser?

45:53.650 --> 45:55.020
你居然不是骑士？
You're not a knight?

45:56.240 --> 45:57.680
女人不能成为骑士

45:57.700 --> 45:59.590
