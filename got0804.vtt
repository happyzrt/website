11:54.670 --> 11:56.500
- 过来吧 大人 - 看见没？
- Come, my lord. - See?

11:56.580 --> 11:58.960
你不是唯一一个聪明人
You're not the only one who's clever.

12:08.670 --> 12:11.630
我得再下去拿一桶
I have to go down and get another barrel.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.830
我们打赢了尸鬼 还能活着讨论这事
We fought dead things and lived to talk about it.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.120
现在不喝点的话 还等什么时候？
If this isn't the time to drink, when is?

12:31.420 --> 12:32.960
上次我见到她的时候
The last time I saw her,

12:33.040 --> 12:36.330
我告诉她再见面时一定会杀了她
I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.170
- 你一定有你的理由 - 我确实有
- I'm sure you had your reasons. - I did.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.710
- 现在也有 - 所以你杀了她吗？
- I do. - So did you?

12:43.880 --> 12:45.790
没给我机会
Never got the chance.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.380
她自己了断了
She did it to herself.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.540
也有可能是她的神了结了她
Or her god did it to her.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.750
光之王
Lord of Light.

12:55.830 --> 13:00.120
我们参与着他的游戏 为他战斗并且取得胜利
We play his game for him, we fight his war and win,

13:00.210 --> 13:01.830
然后
and then

13:01.920 --> 13:03.210
他就滚蛋了
he fucks off.

13:03.290 --> 13:06.670
没有神迹 也没有赐福 鬼知道他到底想要什么？
No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?

13:07.960 --> 13:10.170
还是不要考虑这种事了
I don't imagine thinking about that subject

13:10.180 --> 13:12.120
你才能开心起来
will leave you any happier than before.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.380
要是我原本就不想开心呢？
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

13:16.710 --> 13:17.830
那算你走运
Then you're in luck.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.750
我们纵然打败了异鬼
We may have defeated them,

13:22.830 --> 13:25.750
但还得和自己人斗
but we still have us to contend with.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.790
谢谢 我感觉好多了
Thank you. I feel much better.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.460
再来点麦酒！
More ale!

13:50.040 --> 13:51.380
这东西真精巧
This is clever.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.250
比我给你设计的鞍座还强
Even better than the saddle I designed for you.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.880
这是120年前 戴伦·坦格利安
It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built

13:58.960 --> 14:02.630
为他残废的侄子打造的同款
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.540
我很中意那款
I liked that one.

14:04.630 --> 14:07.790
你比任何人都了解历史
You know our history better than anyone.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.000
要成为临冬城公爵的话这些知识会很有用
That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.040
我不是临冬城公爵
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.120
但你是奈德·史塔克唯一在世的婚生儿子
You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.580
你不想继承这个爵位
You don't want it.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.080
我什么都不想了
I don't really want anymore.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.460
我真嫉妒你
I envy you.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.290
你没必要嫉妒我
You shouldn't envy me.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.790
我基本上活在过去
Mostly I live in the past.

14:42.170 --> 14:43.580
- 全干了 - 赶紧的
- All of it. - Go on.

14:43.670 --> 14:46.250
- 不行 干不了 - 赶紧的 相信你可以
- No, not in one go. - Go on. I believe in you.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.860
<b>托蒙德
</b>“巨人克星”

14:46.330 --> 14:48.380
为胜利而狂欢
We have to celebrate our victory.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.750
醉了狂吐可不算是狂欢
Vomiting is not celebrating.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.630
不 也算
Yes, it is.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.000
来！
Ah!

14:54.080 --> 14:55.580

To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

15:04.710 --> 15:06.920
- 喝！喝！喝！喝！ - 干了！
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! - Drink!

15:19.670 --> 15:21.500
我可没醉！
I'm fine!

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
到你了
Your turn.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.540
呃……
Um...

15:38.420 --> 15:41.540
你是家中独生子女
You are an only child.

<b>波德瑞克·派恩
</b>布蕾妮的侍从

15:42.670 --> 15:44.290

15:44.380 --> 15:47.210
- 我说过了 - 我自己猜的
- I did. - I surmised it.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.830
喝吧
Drink.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.080
再来一次
Go again.

15:51.170 --> 15:52.680
为什么他就可以再来一次？
Why does he get to go again?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.460
因为规矩是我定的
Because it's my game.

15:54.540 --> 15:58.170
你跟蓝礼·拜拉席恩共舞过
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.040
我没说过
No.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.500
继续喝吧
Drink.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.420
换种方式说！
The other way around!

16:05.500 --> 16:07.710
我亲眼看见过他骑着那大家伙
I saw him riding that thing.

16:07.790 --> 16:10.540
- 我们都见过 - 不 不是
- We all did. - No. No.

16:10.630 --> 16:13.880
是我亲眼看见他骑着那大家伙的
I saw him riding that thing.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.960
- 行 是你看见的 - 当然是我
- That's right, you did. - I did.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.790
我们愿意跟随他
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.080
正因为他是这样的汉子
That's the kind of man he is.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.250
他虽然有点小……
He's little...

16:26.250 --> 16:27.830
……但是很强大
...but he's strong.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.790
强大到令敌人折服
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

16:30.880 --> 16:32.120
甚至因此被杀！
and get murdered for it!

16:33.210 --> 16:35.500
大多数人被杀后
Most people get bloody murdered,

16:35.580 --> 16:36.790
就躺那儿不动了
they stay that way.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.500
他可不一样
Not this one.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.290
可别说了 这事我也做不了主啊
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.420
啊哈！他凯旋而归 不断战斗
Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.000
从这出发 打到长城以北 又打回这里
Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.540
他一直战斗 勇往无前
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

16:52.630 --> 16:55.540
他爬上龙背战斗
He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought.

16:55.630 --> 16:58.210
什么人才会爬到龙背上？
What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon?

16:58.290 --> 17:01.540
不是个疯子就是王者！
A madman or a king!

17:16.120 --> 17:18.880

That's a statement about the present.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.210
从过去 直到现在
At no point in the past, up until this very moment,

18:36.210 --> 18:38.210

And what's that?

21:00.830 --> 21:03.210

Heard you were broken in rough.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.830

And he got what he deserved.

我亲手做的
I gave it to him.

No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

21:52.040 --> 21:53.290

I don't know how to be lord of anything.

I hardly know how to use a fork.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.790
我只知道你很美
All I know is that you're beautiful,

23:20.880 --> 23:22.000

如果你不和我在一起

23:24.000 --> 23:25.370
这些就都没有意义了
if you're not with me.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
所以 和我在一起吧
So be with me.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.630
做我的妻子 风息堡的公爵夫人
Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.

23:57.710 --> 24:00.120
你会是一个很好的领主
You'll be a wonderful lord,

24:00.210 --> 24:03.250

and any lady would be lucky to have you.

24:04.630 --> 24:06.080
但我不是一个淑女
But I'm not a lady.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.880

You didn't drink.

24:42.580 --> 24:45.630

24:45.710 --> 24:48.880
- 我喝了 - 还差一杯 这可是多恩的酒
- I drank. - In the game. This is Dornish.

24:51.750 --> 24:55.290
这只是喝酒 不是什么游戏
This is not the game. This is only drinking.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.460

Suit yourself.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.790

You keep it warm enough in here.

25:14.170 --> 25:17.170
这是我到北境后最先学会的事
It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.630
让火一直烧着
Keep your fire going.

25:18.710 --> 25:21.040
每次离开房间都要多添些柴
Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.750
你可真是勤劳有担当
That's very diligent. Very responsible.

25:23.830 --> 25:25.710
- 滚 - 你知道我到北境后
- Piss off. - You know the first thing

25:25.790 --> 25:27.580
明白的第一件事是什么吗？
I learned in the North?

25:27.670 --> 25:29.750
我他妈恨透了北境
I hate the fucking North.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.120
你会慢慢喜欢的
It grows on you.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.460
我才不想喜欢上什么
I don't want things growing on me.

25:37.710 --> 25:41.040
那巨人克星托蒙德呢？
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.630
你喜欢上他了吗？
Has he grown on you?

25:44.290 --> 25:46.290
你离开后他很难过
He was very sad when you left.

25:47.790 --> 25:49.630
听起来你是吃醋了
You sound quite jealous.

25:52.460 --> 25:53.960
不然呢？
I do, don't I?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.830
这里可热死了
It's bloody hot in here.

26:10.630 --> 26:12.000
行吧 手拿开
Oh, move aside.

26:17.670 --> 26:18.710
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

26:19.710 --> 26:21.170
脱你衣服啊
I'm taking your shirt off.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.150


27:08.040 --> 27:10.380
我从没和骑士睡过
I've never slept with a knight before.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.330
我没和任何人睡过
I've never slept with anyone before.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.960
那你得喝酒 这是规矩
Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.420
我跟你说了——
I told you--

27:36.920 --> 27:38.420
你喝醉了吗？
Are you drunk?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.040
没
No.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.380
有一点点
Only a little.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.250
我不太了解乔拉爵士……
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

28:03.670 --> 28:04.920
但我知道一点
but I know this.

28:06.630 --> 28:08.540
如果他能选择死亡的方式
If he could have chosen a way to die,

28:08.630 --> 28:10.630
一定会选择为你战死
it would have been protecting you.

28:11.670 --> 28:12.670
他爱我
He loved me.

28:15.630 --> 28:17.750
但我不能爱他
And I couldn't love him back.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.580
不能像他想要的那样
Not the way he wanted.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.670
不能像我爱你一样
Not the way I love you.

28:29.790 --> 28:31.250
这样可以吗？
Is that all right?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.630
我希望你没告诉我真相
I wish you'd never told me.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.670
如果我不知道 现在就会很开心了
If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.330
我试着忘记
I try to forget.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.380
今晚我忘记了一会儿
Tonight I did for a while,

29:22.460 --> 29:25.250
然后我看到他们围在你身边
and then I saw them gathered around you.

29:26.540 --> 29:29.080
还有他们看你的眼神
I saw the way they looked at you.

29:30.170 --> 29:31.540
我知道那种眼神
I know that look.

29:33.210 --> 29:36.710
以前很多人那样看过我 但不是在这儿
So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.

29:36.790 --> 29:38.380
在这片大陆上 从来没有过
Never on this side of the sea.

29:39.830 --> 29:41.450
我说过我不想要铁王座
I told you I don't want it.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.750
他们不在乎你想不想要
It doesn't matter what you want.

29:43.830 --> 29:46.220
之前你也不想当北境之王
You didn't want to be King in the North.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.330
如果他们要求你称王
What happens when they demand you press your claim,

29:48.340 --> 29:49.880
从我手上夺走王位呢？
and take what is mine?

29:53.330 --> 29:55.170
我会拒绝的
I'll refuse.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.790
你是我的女王 我不知道我还能说些什么
You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.080
你可以守口如瓶
You can say nothing.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.630
永远不跟任何人说
To anyone, ever.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.710
永远不告诉他们你的真实身份
Never tell them who you really are.

30:03.790 --> 30:06.260
让你的弟弟和山姆威尔·塔利发誓保密
Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

30:06.270 --> 30:07.500
绝不说出去
and tell no one else.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.210
不然事情传出去
Or it will take on a life of its own

30:09.290 --> 30:11.000
你根本无法控制
and you won't be able to control it

30:11.000 --> 30:12.490
更不知道会有什么影响
or what it does to people.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.880
不管你下跪称臣多少次
No matter how many times you bend the knee,

30:14.960 --> 30:16.920
你再怎么发誓 都无济于事
no matter what you swear.

30:22.080 --> 30:25.540
我希望我们还像从前那样
I want it to be the way it was between us.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.540
我必须告诉珊莎和艾莉亚
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

30:36.630 --> 30:43.000
珊莎会想让我走 然后你坐上铁王座
Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.750
她不会的
She won't.

30:44.830 --> 30:47.880
她不是和你一起长大的那个女孩了
She's not the girl you grew up with.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.250
在她目睹了这么多
Not after what she's seen,

30:50.330 --> 30:52.960
遭受过这么多之后 早就不是了
not after what they've done to her.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.210
我应该告诉她们真相
I owe them the truth.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.170
即使这会毁掉我们俩？
Even if the truth destroys us?

31:01.250 --> 31:02.960
- 不会的 - 不 它会的
- It won't. - It will.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.590
我从未因为任何事求过别人……
I've never begged for anything...

31:08.540 --> 31:10.710
但是我现在求你
but I'm begging you.

31:10.790 --> 31:13.790
不要这么做 拜托了
Don't do this. Please.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.790
你是我的女王
You are my queen.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.250
这是不会改变的
Nothing will change that.

31:28.170 --> 31:29.880
她们是我的家人
And they are my family.

31:31.830 --> 31:33.500
我们可以一起生活
We can live together.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.380
的确可以
We can.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.330
我也告诉你该怎么做了
I've just told you how.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.330
无垢者损失了半数
Half are gone.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.670
北境军队也是
The Northmen as well.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.210
黄金团已经到达君临
And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing,

32:37.290 --> 32:39.290
多亏了葛雷乔伊的舰队
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

32:39.380 --> 32:43.080
双方实力已经均等得令人烦恼了
The balance has grown distressingly even.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.960
当人们发现我们为他们做了什么
When the people find out what we have done for them,

32:46.040 --> 32:47.290
我们拯救了他们——
that we saved them--

32:47.380 --> 32:49.710
瑟曦会确保人们不会相信的
Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.

32:51.710 --> 32:53.330
我们会痛击她
We will hit her hard.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.630
我们必将她连根拔起 铲除殆尽
We will rip her out root and stem.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.710
这次会议的议题是怎么除掉瑟曦
The objective here is to remove Cersei

32:59.790 --> 33:02.460
同时不毁掉君临
without destroying King's Landing.

33:05.580 --> 33:09.420
谢天谢地 她的盟友在弃她而去
Thankfully,she's losing allies by the day.

33:09.500 --> 33:12.330
亚拉·葛雷乔伊已经以女王之名
Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands

33:12.420 --> 33:13.710
重新夺回铁群岛
in her queen's name.

33:13.790 --> 33:16.460
多恩的新亲王也承诺他会提供援助
The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.810
不管有多少贵族对瑟曦倒戈相向
No matter how many lords turn against her,

33:18.820 --> 33:20.660
只要她还坐在铁王座上
as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,

33:20.660 --> 33:23.250
她就可以自称是七大王国的女王
she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.330
我们得拿下都城
We need the capital.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.600
我见过君临的人们
I watched the people of King's Landing

33:29.610 --> 33:31.540
在极度饥饿下反抗他们的国王
rebel against their king when they were hungry,

33:31.630 --> 33:33.830
这还是在凛冬来临之前的事情
and that was before winter began.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.460
给他们这个机会 他们会推翻瑟曦
Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.

33:39.170 --> 33:41.540
我们出军包围整座城
We'll surround the city.

33:41.630 --> 33:43.880
如果铁舰队试图往城里运输食物
If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food,

33:43.960 --> 33:46.040
龙可以消灭他们
the dragons will destroy them.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.540
如果兰尼斯特军队和黄金团发动进攻
If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack,

33:48.630 --> 33:50.290
我们会在战场上打败他们
we'll defeat them in the field.

33:50.380 --> 33:54.040
一旦人们意识到我们只视瑟曦为敌人
Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy,

33:54.120 --> 33:56.120
她的统治就结束了
her reign is over.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.750
那好吧
All right.

34:02.830 --> 34:05.960
我们剩下的人马都筋疲力竭
The men we have left are exhausted.

34:05.990 --> 34:07.250
大部分都受了伤
Many of them are wounded.

34:07.330 --> 34:09.210
如果能给他们时间休息恢复
They'll fight better if they have time to

34:09.230 --> 34:10.670
他们能更好地打下一场仗
rest and recuperate.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.170
你建议恢复多久？
How long do you suggest?

34:14.330 --> 34:15.830
我不确定
I can't say for certain,

34:15.920 --> 34:17.960
得和长官们聊聊才知道
not without talking to the officers.

34:21.330 --> 34:24.210
我来到北境和你并肩作战
I came north to fight alongside you

34:24.290 --> 34:26.830
这场战争也让我损失惨重
at great cost to my armies and myself.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.920
现在该是你回报我的时候
Now that the time has come to reciprocate,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.790
你却想推迟
you want to postpone.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.750
那不仅是我们的人民 也是您的
It's not just our people.It's yours.

34:35.830 --> 34:37.460
您想让他们没准备好
You want to throw them into a war

34:37.540 --> 34:39.080
就上战场？
they're not ready to fight?

34:39.170 --> 34:40.880
我给敌人的准备时间越长
The longer I leave my enemies alone,

34:40.960 --> 34:42.460
他们就会越强大
the stronger they become.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.540
北境会向七大王国的女王
The Northern forces will honor their promises

34:49.630 --> 34:50.920
遵守他们的承诺
and their allegiance

34:51.000 --> 34:53.500
并保持忠诚
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.710
您的命令 我们必将服从
What you command, we will obey.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.040
那么……
So...

35:07.120 --> 35:10.040
既然我们达成了一致……
if all are in agreement...

35:10.120 --> 35:13.400
琼恩和戴佛斯爵士沿着国王大道
Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad

35:13.400 --> 35:14.460
率领北境军队
with the Northern troops

35:14.480 --> 35:17.330
以及多斯拉克人和无垢者残部的多数南下
and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.

35:17.340 --> 35:20.050
我们小部分人先骑马到白港
A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor,

35:20.060 --> 35:21.720
然后坐船前往龙石岛
and sail from there to Dragonstone

35:21.730 --> 35:25.250
女王和她的龙与我们一路
with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.

35:25.330 --> 35:28.000
詹姆爵士选择留在这里
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,

35:28.080 --> 35:30.380
作为临冬城公爵夫人的客人
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.330
我们已经打赢了生死之战
We have won the Great War.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.080
现在 我们将拿下最后一战
Now we will win the Last War.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.380
从此七国之内
In all Seven Kingdoms,

35:41.460 --> 35:44.250
在正统的女王统治下人们将不会生活在
men will live without fear and cruelty

35:45.330 --> 35:46.750
恐惧和残忍的压迫之中
under their rightful queen.

36:00.210 --> 36:01.380
我们得聊聊
We need a word.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.460
你们要知道 多亏了她 不然我们都会死
You understand we'd all be dead if not for her.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.830
都会变成向君临进军的死尸
We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.650
艾莉亚才是杀掉夜王的人
Arya's the one that killed the Night King.

36:12.650 --> 36:14.750
她的人为了保护临冬城送了命——
Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--

36:14.750 --> 36:16.170
我们永远不会忘记他们
And we will never forget them.

36:16.180 --> 36:18.100
但这并不意味着我想向她俯首称臣——
That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--

36:18.110 --> 36:20.880
我曾发誓我自己和北境都效忠于她的大业
I swore myself and the North to her cause.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.500
我尊重你的决定
I respect that.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.790
你真尊重？
You respect it?

36:27.500 --> 36:29.250
我们之前需要她
We needed her.

36:30.630 --> 36:33.250
需要她的军队和龙
We needed her army, her dragons.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.830
你做了正确的选择
You did the right thing.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.330
而我们现在正确的做法就是告诉你
And we're doing the right thing telling you

36:39.420 --> 36:40.960
我们不相信你的女王
we don't trust your queen.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.170
- 你还不了解她 - 我永远都不会了解她
- You don't know her yet. - I'll never know her.

36:45.250 --> 36:46.540
她不是我们中的一员
She's not one of us.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.700
如果你只相信和你一起长大的人
If you only trust the people you grew up with,

36:48.700 --> 36:50.170
你没法结交很多的盟友
you won't make many allies.

36:50.170 --> 36:51.580
那有什么关系
That's all right.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.790
我不需要那么多盟友
I don't need many allies.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.120
- 艾莉亚…… - 我们是一家人
- Arya... - We're family.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.670
我们四个
The four of us.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.460
是最后的史塔克
The last of the Starks.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.960
我从来都不是史塔克家族的人
I've never been a Stark.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.710
你是
You are.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.790
你跟我们一样 都是奈德·史塔克的孩子
You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.750
你是我的哥哥
You're my brother.

37:14.830 --> 37:17.330
不是同父异母的哥哥或是私生子哥哥
Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.710
而是我的哥哥
My brother.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.000
说不说看你了
It's your choice.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.380
我要告诉你们一件事
I need to tell you something.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.380
但是你们得发誓不会告诉任何人
But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.

37:46.670 --> 37:48.000
什么事？
What is it?

37:49.290 --> 37:52.330
你得先发誓 我才能告诉你
You have to swear it,before I tell you.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.500
如果我连秘密是什么还不知道
How can I promise to keep a secret

37:54.500 --> 37:55.680
我怎么能发誓？
if I don't even know what it is?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.380
因为我们是一家人
Because we're family.

38:02.460 --> 38:03.420
发誓
Swear it.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.170
我发誓
I swear it.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.830
我也发誓
I swear it.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.170
告诉她们吧
Tell them.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.250
所以她会跟你一起留下？
So she's going to stay here with you?

38:36.710 --> 38:39.920
她曾发誓会保护史塔克家的姑娘们 所以……
She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so...

38:43.250 --> 38:44.710
尽管冷嘲热讽吧
Say something snide.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
我很高兴
I'm happy.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.750
看到你开心 我也替你高兴
I'm happy that you're happy.

38:51.670 --> 38:55.040
看到你终于也得爬上去干那事 我高兴得不得了
I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.380
你知道我等着讲高个子的荤段子等了多久吗？
Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes?

39:01.580 --> 39:03.880
敬攀上高峰
To climbing mountains.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.420
敬攀上高峰
To climbing mountains.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
- 她下面是什么样子？ - 什么？
- What's she like down there? - What?

39:11.080 --> 39:13.040
不关你事
That's not your concern.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.670
我已经好几年没碰女人了
I haven't been with a woman for years.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.250
- 透露一点嘛  - 你个狗玩东西
- Give me a morsel. - You're a dog.

39:17.330 --> 39:19.210
我是小恶魔 我就是要知道
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.080
我知道你干了她
I knew you were fucking her.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.300
<b>波隆
</b>黑水河骑士

39:23.000 --> 39:24.920
一对高个 金发的上流社会人士
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.670
你肯定觉得像在照镜子吧
Must be like looking in the mirror.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.580
黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

39:30.210 --> 39:31.960
不带酒就来了？
Where's your drink?

39:32.040 --> 39:34.170
你来——你来北境做什么？
What are you--What are you doing up North?

39:34.250 --> 39:35.710
你拿着那个要干嘛？
What are you doing with that?

39:35.790 --> 39:37.330
噢 这个？
Oh, this?

39:37.420 --> 39:38.460
这是给你们准备的
This is for you.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.040
你俩都有份
For both of you.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.210
你不是该待在南方么
You're supposed to be south.

39:43.290 --> 39:45.210
你们两兄弟是一对镀金的傻屌
You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.

39:45.290 --> 39:46.790
- 你们知道吗？  - 这很没礼貌啊
- Do you know that? - That's a bit rude.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.080
这些年我都在铲你们兰尼斯特家族的臭屎
Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit,

39:49.170 --> 39:52.080
- 我得到了什么值得夸耀的呢？ - 多亏我 你成了骑士
- and what do I have to show? - You're a knight, thanks to me.

39:52.170 --> 39:54.140
多亏了我自己 而且那个头衔跟你哥蛋蛋上的
Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much

39:54.140 --> 39:56.160
一根金色屌毛一样不值钱
as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.770
价值在于人们相信——
Power resides where men believe--

39:57.790 --> 39:59.750
你闭嘴
Shut your mouth.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.170
- 我只是想—— - 我从来没揍过侏儒
- I'm just trying-- - I've never hit a dwarf before,

40:02.250 --> 40:04.120
但是你再逼逼一句 我就抽你
but say another word and I will belt you.

40:04.210 --> 40:06.750
你看 我不信你会这样做 毕竟——
See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--

40:06.830 --> 40:08.580
你这个独臂杂种
You couldn't do it on your best day,

40:08.670 --> 40:09.750
在你全盛时期也打不过我
you one-handed fuck.

40:09.830 --> 40:11.420
更何况那已经是很久以前了
And your best days are long gone.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.000
你把我的鼻子打破了！
You broke my nose!

40:13.080 --> 40:15.270
- 我没有打破你的鼻子  - 你怎么知道？
- I did not break your nose. - How do you know?

40:15.270 --> 40:17.380
因为我像你这么高的时候就已经打破别人鼻子了
Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size,

40:17.380 --> 40:20.170
我知道该是什么声儿 现在给我听着
and I know what it sounds like. Now listen.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.830
你们老姐许诺给我奔流城
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.420
漂亮的大城堡 肥沃的土地
Nice big castle, good lands,

40:24.500 --> 40:26.540
很多言听计从的农民
plenty of peasants who do what they're told.

40:26.630 --> 40:29.290
- 而你相信瑟曦—— - 我当时看到那几只龙的时候
- And you trust Cersei— - I knew your sister was dead

40:29.380 --> 40:31.170
就知道你们老姐死定了
the second I saw those dragons.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.280
现在 或许你们的军队被虐成渣了
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

40:33.290 --> 40:35.610
但我还是赌你们的龙女王赢
but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.710
正好我是个赌徒
And it just so happens I'm a betting man.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.880
如果瑟曦死了 她就不能兑现承诺了
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

40:44.210 --> 40:46.480
嗯 这酒不错 当然 如果龙女王的首相暴毙了
Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change

40:46.480 --> 40:48.460
双方输赢的几率就变了
if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.

40:48.540 --> 40:51.420
她的几个大将可能会一个接一个被干掉
Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.420
- 突然…… - 我能说两句吗？
- All of a sudden… - May I speak?

40:53.500 --> 40:56.170
当然 你只有死了才能闭嘴
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.380
你还记得我们很久以前达成的协议吗？
We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.630
如果有人出钱
If anyone offered me money

41:03.640 --> 41:05.960
让我杀你 你会付我双倍
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.500
奔流城的双倍是什么？
What's double Riverrun?

41:08.540 --> 41:09.540
高庭
Highgarden.

41:11.710 --> 41:13.740
你可以成为河湾地的领主
You could be Lord of the Reach.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.120
- 高庭？你疯了吗？ - 总比让我们死好
- Highgarden? Are you mad? - It's better than being dead.

41:16.210 --> 41:17.420
他不会杀我们的
He's not going to kill us.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.250
否则不会跟我们说这么多——
He wouldn't be talking to us if--

41:22.250 --> 41:23.500
看来
The way I see it,

41:23.580 --> 41:26.250
我只需要让一个兰尼斯特兄弟活着
I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.

41:26.330 --> 41:28.460
高庭不能属于一个杀手
Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.

41:28.540 --> 41:30.670
不能？ 让你们家族繁荣起来的
No? Who were your ancestors,

41:30.750 --> 41:32.920
祖先是什么人？
the ones who made your family rich?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.580
穿着丝绸的花哨小伙子？
Fancy lads in silk?

41:34.670 --> 41:36.330
他们也不过是杀手
They were fucking cutthroats.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.830
所有的大家族都是这么发展起来的 不是吗？
That's how all the great houses started, isn't it?

41:38.920 --> 41:41.330
靠一个擅长杀人的混蛋白手起家
With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.

41:41.420 --> 41:43.750
杀几百个人 他们封你作领主
Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.

41:43.830 --> 41:45.830
杀几千个人 他们拥戴你当王
Kill a few thousand, they make you king.

41:45.920 --> 41:50.330
然后你的傻屌后代们就可以用他们的傻屌方式
And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family

41:50.420 --> 41:51.960
毁了这个家族
with their cocksucking ways.

41:55.790 --> 41:56.790
高庭
Highgarden.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.120
你向我保证
Give me your word.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.330
我向你保证
You have my word.

42:05.210 --> 42:08.580
没拿下君临之前说这些都没有意义
None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.

42:09.710 --> 42:12.120
我们明早启程 进军南方
We ride south in the morning.

42:12.210 --> 42:13.630
我们需要一个对君临防卫情况
We could use an officer

42:13.640 --> 42:15.880
了如指掌的人 作我们的军官
with knowledge of the city's defenses.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.040
噢 算了吧
Oh, no.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.710
不了 我打仗的日子已经结束了
No, my fighting days are done.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.830
但我杀人的日子还没结束 你们懂了吗
But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me?

42:22.920 --> 42:25.540
等战争结束了我会来找你们
I'll come find you when the war is done.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.920
别在那之前死了
Till then, don't die.

42:52.710 --> 42:54.830
我日
For fuck's sake.

42:56.380 --> 42:57.460
你一个人？
On your own?

42:58.670 --> 43:00.170
现在不是了
Not anymore.

43:01.670 --> 43:03.290
我不喜欢热闹
I don't like crowds.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.000
我也是
Me neither.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.380
为什么？他们现在都很喜欢你
Why not? They all love you now.

43:09.460 --> 43:11.040
你是大英雄
You're the big hero.

43:12.210 --> 43:13.790
我不喜欢当英雄
Don't like heroes.

43:15.750 --> 43:19.210
用匕首刺死那个长角的混蛋肯定很爽吧
It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.210
比死感觉好一点
Felt better than dying.

43:25.670 --> 43:27.380
你打算去君临？
You're heading to King's Landing?

43:28.670 --> 43:31.080
我还有些事没做了断
I have some unfinished business.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.830
我也是
Me too.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.040
我没准备回来
I don't plan on coming back.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.040
我也是
Neither do I.

43:47.670 --> 43:50.040
如果我受伤了 你打算又让我自己等死吗？
Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?

43:52.380 --> 43:53.290
有可能
Probably.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.830
<b>雷哥
</b>丹妮莉丝的绿龙

44:07.000 --> 44:09.370
<b>卓耿
</b>丹妮莉丝的黑龙

44:37.580 --> 44:38.540
夫人
My lady.

44:42.830 --> 44:45.580
标准的回答应该是“大人”
"My lord" is the standard response.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.420
为什么是她？
Why her?

44:53.460 --> 44:55.460
你知道她爱你哥哥
You know she loves your brother.

44:55.540 --> 44:57.670
那并不意味着她能成为一个好的女王
That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.580
你似乎打定主意就是要不喜欢她
You seem determined to dislike her.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.480
铁王座和北境
A good relationship

45:04.490 --> 45:05.950
维持良好的关系
between the Iron Throne and the North

45:05.960 --> 45:07.720
一直都是以往任何和平 繁荣
has been the core of every peaceful,

45:07.720 --> 45:09.230
统治的关键
prosperous reign we've ever known.

45:09.230 --> 45:10.710
琼恩会成为北境守护
Jon will be Warden of the North,

45:10.790 --> 45:12.790
所以 应该会维持良好关系吧
so a good relationship seems likely.

45:14.500 --> 45:17.710
我认为今后他不会在这里呆太久
I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.

45:17.790 --> 45:19.790
好吧 我想这得由他自己决定
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.500
珊莎 看着我
Sansa, look at me.

45:31.250 --> 45:33.420
要是琼恩待在首都
With Jon in the capital,

45:33.500 --> 45:36.170
你就会成为北境的真正掌权者
you'll be the true power in the North.

45:36.250 --> 45:38.440
如果我今天离开这里的时候可以确信
I'd feel much better about the future

45:38.440 --> 45:39.910
你和丹妮莉丝是盟友
if I left here today believing

45:39.910 --> 45:41.510
我会对未来更有信心
that you and Daenerys were allies.

45:41.520 --> 45:45.260
你在担心什么？ 琼恩会带着我们的军队一起走
What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.

45:45.260 --> 45:46.490
你们的女王还拥有她的龙
Your queen still has her dragons--

45:46.490 --> 45:47.960
她也是你的女王
She's your queen too.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.250
你不必做她的朋友
You don't have to be her friend.

45:57.330 --> 45:59.250
但你为什么非得招惹她呢？
But why provoke her?

45:59.330 --> 46:01.580
这对你的家族有什么好处呢？
How is that in the best interest of your family,

46:01.670 --> 46:04.080
- 对北境  或是对——？ - 你害怕她
- or the North, or--? - You're afraid of her.

46:06.540 --> 46:10.880
每一位优秀的统治者都需要让臣民有敬畏之心
Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.750
我不想让琼恩南下君临
I don't want Jon to go down there.

46:15.830 --> 46:19.500
我们家族的男人去了君临都没好事
The men in my family don't do well in the capital.

46:19.580 --> 46:22.290
对 可你的哥哥告诉过我
No, but as your brother once told me,

46:22.380 --> 46:23.750
他不是史塔克家族的人
he's not a Stark.

46:29.330 --> 46:30.710
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

46:37.210 --> 46:39.790
你看到了 她的臣民爱戴她
Her people love her, you've seen that.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.210
你看到了他们如何为她战斗
You've seen how they fight for her.

46:42.290 --> 46:45.460
她想让世界变得更好
She wants to make the world a better place.

46:47.790 --> 46:49.880
我相信她
I believe in her.

47:04.750 --> 47:06.080
提利昂
Tyrion.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.500
如果还有其他人呢？
What if there's someone else?

47:11.580 --> 47:13.210
其他更好的人选呢？
Someone better?

47:21.540 --> 47:23.580
你不打算骑龙去南方吗？
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

47:27.290 --> 47:28.460
就骑马去
Just a horse.

47:29.790 --> 47:30.960
雷哥需要养伤
Rhaegal needs to heal.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.750
我不能成为他的负担
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

47:32.830 --> 47:36.170
你只有两只跳蚤那么重
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

47:37.460 --> 47:39.120
我要带自由民回家了
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.880
我们受够了南方
We've had enough of the south.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.000
这儿的女人不喜欢我
The women down here don't like me.

47:47.080 --> 47:49.250
你知道的 这就是北方
This is the North, you know.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.920
欢迎自由民留在这儿
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

47:54.460 --> 47:56.120
这儿不是家
It isn't home.

47:56.210 --> 47:57.670
我们需要能游荡的空间
We need room to wander.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.830
等冬天的暴风雪一停
I'll take them back through Castle Black

47:59.920 --> 48:02.380
我就带他们穿过黑城堡
as soon as the winter storms pass.

48:02.460 --> 48:04.120
回到我们的地盘
Back where we belong.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.420
也是它的地盘
It's where he belongs too.

48:10.500 --> 48:13.210
冰原狼不适合待在南方
A direwolf has no place in the south.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.830
你能带上它吗？
Will you take him with you?

48:18.080 --> 48:20.040
它在那儿会更自在些
He'll be happier up there.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.380
你也会的
So would you.

48:24.380 --> 48:26.790
我真希望能和你一起去
I wish I was going with you.

48:31.170 --> 48:32.460
那么就 永别了
This is farewell, then.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.710
谁知道呢
You never know.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.170
你现在是个北方人了
You've got the North in you.

48:45.670 --> 48:47.120
我是说真正的北方人
The real North.

49:19.630 --> 49:22.790
好吧 黑夜越来越长
Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer

49:22.880 --> 49:25.460
在旧镇又没有什么可做的
and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.

49:25.540 --> 49:28.170
总不能老看书吧 所以我们——
There's only so many books a person can read, so we--

49:28.250 --> 49:30.960
山姆 我确定他知道这是怎么发生的
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

49:34.250 --> 49:36.920
如果是个男孩 我们想叫他琼恩
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

49:40.250 --> 49:41.750
我希望是个女孩
I hope it's a girl.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.710
你是我最好的朋友
You're the best friend I ever had.

50:05.170 --> 50:07.210
你也是 山姆
You too, Sam.

51:07.750 --> 51:10.040
想想过去的二十年
Think of the past 20 years.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.960
战争 谋杀 痛苦
The war, the murder, the misery.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.670
全都是因为劳勃·拜拉席恩爱上一个
All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone

51:16.670 --> 51:18.460
不爱他的人
who didn't love him back.

51:20.540 --> 51:21.710
还有多少人知道？
How many others know?

51:23.500 --> 51:26.120
加上咱俩？八个
Including us? Eight.

51:26.210 --> 51:28.290
好吧 这不再是个秘密了
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

51:28.380 --> 51:30.170
而是信息
It's information.

51:30.250 --> 51:33.580
如果现在个别人知道了 很快就会有几百人知道
If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.

51:33.670 --> 51:35.080
接着会发生什么？
Then what happens?

51:35.170 --> 51:36.750
她会失去北境
She loses the North.

51:36.830 --> 51:39.630
她会失去谷地 珊莎保准会做到
She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.

51:39.710 --> 51:41.120
不 比这更糟
No, it's worse than that.

51:41.210 --> 51:43.960
他的继承顺位更靠前
He has the better claim to the throne.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.250
他不想要王位
He doesn't want the throne.

51:46.330 --> 51:48.750
他的想法并不重要
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

51:49.960 --> 51:53.210
事实是 他是人心所向的
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

51:53.290 --> 51:55.000
野人 北境人
Wildlings, Northmen.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.250
他是战争中的英雄
He's a war hero.

52:02.710 --> 52:04.880
他爱我们的女王
He loves our queen.

52:06.420 --> 52:07.710
她也爱他
And she loves him.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.330
如果我们让他们结婚 他们可以共同统治
If we marry them, they could rule together.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.540
但她是他的姑妈
She's his aunt.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.190
这可从来阻止不了一位坦格利安人
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

52:16.190 --> 52:18.050
不 可琼恩在临冬城长大
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

52:18.050 --> 52:20.340
在北境 娶自己的姑妈正常吗？
Is marrying your aunt common in the North?

52:22.830 --> 52:24.500
你比我更了解我们的女王
You know our queen better than I do.

52:24.520 --> 52:27.290
你觉得她想分享王座吗？
Do you think she wants to share the throne?

52:27.380 --> 52:29.920
她可不喜欢她的权威被质疑
She does not like to have her authority questioned.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.250
这是她和每位
Something she has in common

52:31.330 --> 52:33.920
君王的共同点
with every monarch who ever lived.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.790
我担心她的精神状态
I worry about her state of mind.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.000
我们是女王的顾问
We are advisors to the queen.

52:38.080 --> 52:41.420
担心她的精神状态是我们的职责
Worrying about her state of mind is our job.

52:49.380 --> 52:51.420
我们仍需拿下君临
We still have to take King's Landing.

52:52.580 --> 52:55.140
也许瑟曦会赢 然后把我们都杀了
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

52:55.250 --> 52:57.540
这倒能解决我们的问题
That would solve our problems.

54:08.510 --> 54:10.380
<b>攸伦·葛雷乔伊
</b>铁群岛之王

55:01.080 --> 55:03.540
到小船上去 快！
Get to the skiff. Now!

55:05.630 --> 55:07.080
矛！
Spears!

55:07.170 --> 55:09.120
他们又来了！
They're coming round again!

55:17.750 --> 55:19.210
上！
Go!

55:19.290 --> 55:20.500
明白！
Clear!

55:20.580 --> 55:22.460
守住阵地！
Man your stations!

55:22.540 --> 55:24.210
不！
No!

55:42.120 --> 55:44.710
- 上！上！ - 明白！
- Go! Go! - Clear!

56:20.420 --> 56:21.500
弥桑黛？
Missandei?

56:23.080 --> 56:24.330
弥桑黛！
Missandei!

56:30.420 --> 56:31.830
弥桑黛！
Missandei!

56:36.750 --> 56:38.750
那么 我们的消息反响很好 ？
Our message was well-received, then?

56:38.830 --> 56:42.120
您的人民听说了篡夺者要来
Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.

56:42.210 --> 56:44.710
他们很感激您对他们的保护
They are grateful for your protection

56:44.170 --> 56:47.550
<b>瑟曦·兰尼斯特
</b>铁王座上的女王

56:44.790 --> 56:47.170
感激您让他们进入红堡的城墙之内
within the walls of the Red Keep.

56:49.390 --> 56:52.130
<b>科本
</b>被剥夺项链的学士 瑟曦的女王之手

56:49.420 --> 56:51.380
你确定龙死了？
You're certain about the dragon?

56:51.460 --> 56:53.710
我看着它没入海浪
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

56:53.790 --> 56:56.040
那肯定很壮观
That must have been glorious.

56:58.250 --> 57:00.380
这都属于您 我的女王
The glory is yours, my queen.

57:01.880 --> 57:04.380
等战争胜利 狮子将统治大陆
When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land,

57:04.460 --> 57:06.120
海怪将会统治大海
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

57:07.500 --> 57:10.710
而我们的孩子终有一天将统治这一切
and our child shall one day rule them all.

57:27.540 --> 57:29.250
她冲着您来了
She's coming for you.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.580
当然是冲着我来
Of course she is.

57:34.380 --> 57:36.080
就让大门开着
Keep the gates open.

57:36.170 --> 57:38.790
如果她想占领城堡
If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder

57:38.880 --> 57:41.380
她得先屠杀成千上万无辜的人
thousands of innocent people first.

57:47.460 --> 57:49.960
所谓“镣铐破除者”不过如此
So much for "the Breaker of Chains."

58:03.500 --> 58:05.960
我们会攻克此城 女王陛下
We will storm the city, my queen.

58:06.040 --> 58:09.250
我们会杀死您的敌人 杀死他们所有人
We will kill your enemies. All of them.

58:09.330 --> 58:10.420
陛下
Your Grace.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.670
我曾向您保证 假如我认为您犯了错误
I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly

58:15.750 --> 58:18.080
我会直视您的眼睛并进献直言
if I ever thought you were making a mistake.

58:21.630 --> 58:24.380
这是个错误
This is a mistake.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.460
你看到我的孩子从空中坠落
You saw my child fall from the sky.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.080
他们还抓走了弥桑黛
They took Missandei.

58:33.170 --> 58:35.170
瑟曦必须被摧毁
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

58:35.250 --> 58:39.460
但如果我们让龙和无垢者还有多斯拉克人
but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied

58:39.540 --> 58:40.750
进攻君临
and the Dothraki,

58:40.830 --> 58:43.000
上万无辜的人会死去
tens of thousands of innocents will die.

58:43.080 --> 58:47.790
这就是瑟曦带他们进入红堡的原因
That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.

58:47.880 --> 58:51.540
你来到这里就是为了保护这些民众啊
These are the people you came here to protect.

58:51.630 --> 58:53.250
我求您 陛下
I beg you, Your Grace.

58:53.330 --> 58:57.040
不要毁了这座您想要拯救的城市
Do not destroy the city you came to save.

58:57.120 --> 59:00.960
不要变成您一直努力打败的敌人
Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

59:05.790 --> 59:08.830
瓦里斯大人 你相信我们来到这里是有原因的吗
Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys?

59:12.290 --> 59:15.380
我来到这里 是为了从暴君手中解放这个世界
I'm here to free the world from tyrants.

59:16.540 --> 59:18.000
这是我的宿命
That is my destiny...

59:19.330 --> 59:22.290
我会忠于我命 不计代价
and I will serve it, no matter the cost.

59:29.250 --> 59:32.080
琼恩和盟军可能要两星期
It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies

59:32.170 --> 59:34.170
才能到达君临
make it to King's Landing.

59:34.250 --> 59:37.080
与此同时 要求瑟曦投降
In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.

59:37.170 --> 59:40.500
让她用王位换她的命
Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.

59:42.040 --> 59:44.540
如果有一线机会能避免屠杀
If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter,

59:44.630 --> 59:47.040
我们就应该为之努力
we should make the effort.

59:47.120 --> 59:50.000
与瑟曦对话阻止不了屠杀
Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.

59:52.250 --> 59:54.230
但或许让人们看清楚也好
But perhaps it's good the people see

59:54.230 --> 59:57.920
“风暴降生”丹妮莉丝做了所有避免民众流血的努力
that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.330
但瑟曦·兰尼斯特拒绝了
and Cersei Lannister refused.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.460
当天罚降临时
They should know whom to blame

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.670
他们该知道谁才是罪魁祸首
when the sky falls down upon them.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.420
我大半辈子都在辅佐暴君
I've served tyrants most of my life.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.630
他们都爱说宿命
They all talk about destiny.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.960
这个女孩带着三块石头走进火中
She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.710
然后带着三条龙出来了
and walked out with three dragons.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:35.540
她怎么能不相信宿命？
How could she not believe in destiny?

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.500
也许这就是问题所在
Perhaps that's the problem.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.100
她的经历使她相信
Her life has convinced her

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.750
她是命运派来拯救我们的
that she was sent here to save us all.

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.750
你又怎么知道她不是呢？
And how do you know she wasn't?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.920
那我们就要聊聊琼恩·雪诺的问题了
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.210
也许他实际上才是答案
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.170
他们俩你都了解
You know them both.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.380
告诉我 你觉得谁会是更好的统治者？
Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:09.420
他不想要王位
He doesn't want the throne.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.960
因此他才臣服
That's why he bent the knee.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.120
你有没有想过 最好的统治者
Have you considered the best ruler

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.630
可能恰恰是不想统治的人？
might be someone who doesn't want to rule?

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.000
我们在讨论叛国
We're discussing treason.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.750
不要假装你没有想过
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:25.170
我当然想过 光想想又不算叛国
Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:31.290
他温和 又有分寸 而且是个男人
He's temperate and measured. He's a man,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.120
这会让他更对维斯特洛领主们的胃口
which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros,

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:36.460
而我们需要他们的支持
whose support we are going to need.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.960
乔佛里也是男人
Joffrey was a man.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.290
我不觉得有鸡巴就真有资格
I don't think a cock is a true qualification,

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.500
我相信你也会同意
as I'm sure you'd agree.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.540
他是王位的继承人
And he's the heir to the throne.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:47.630
没错 因为他是个男人 恐怕鸡巴确实是重要的
Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.540
那我之前的提议呢？
What about my earlier proposal?

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.070
他们可以共同统治 作为国王和女王
They could rule together as king and queen.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.790
她太强势
She's too strong for him.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.420
她会迫使他服从她的意志 正如她所做的
She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.580
他可以缓和她糟糕的冲动
He could temper her worst impulses.

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.630
正如你所做的？
As you have?

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.880
你喝了不少了
You're drinking quite a lot.

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:19.920
一个坦格利安父亲和一个史塔克母亲
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.290
琼恩是唯一有可能
Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.090
让北境继续留在七国之内的人了
to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:26.630
你效忠过多少个国王或女王？
How many kings and queens have you served?

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:27.910
五个？六个？我都数不过来了
Five? Six? I've lost count.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.110
- 你一直都知道我的理由 - 在某一时刻
- You've always known my reasons. - At a certain point,

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:31.840
你选择一个你相信的人
you choose a person you believe in,

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.170
然后你为之战斗
and you fight for that person.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.330
哪怕你知道这是一个错误？
Even if you know it's a mistake?

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.880
我相信我们的女王
I believe in our queen.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.630
她会做出正确的选择
She'll make the right choice.

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.080
由她忠诚的谋臣辅佐
With the help of her loyal advisors.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:54.210
你知道我的忠心所向
You know where my loyalty stands.

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.580
你知道我永远不会背叛国家
You know I will never betray the realm.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.960
什么是国家？
What is the realm?

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.170
一个广阔的大陆 几百万人的家
A vast continent, home to millions of people,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.380
这几百万人中 大多数并不在乎谁坐在铁王座上
most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.580
假如错误的人坐上王座
Millions of people, many of whom will die

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.000
这几百万人中 许多人会死去
if the wrong person sits on that throne.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.490
我们不知道他们的名字
We don't know their names,

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.250
但他们就像你和我一样真实存在
but they're just as real as you and I.

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.540
他们有活着的权利
They deserve to live.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.730
他们应该能够喂养他们的孩子
They deserve food for their children.

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:21.580
我将以他们的利益为重 而不计个人的得失
I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.380
那 她身上会发生什么？
So, what happens to her?

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:35.540
拜托
Please.

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.920
不要
Don't.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.080
我已经尽可能坦诚了
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.290
我们每个人都有一个选择要做
Each of us has a choice to make.

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.290
我祈祷我们都能明智
I pray we choose wisely.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.960
……她的其他顾问也一样
...as are the rest of her advisors.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:34.330
发生什么了？
What happened?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.330
攸伦·葛雷乔伊伏击了丹妮莉丝女王以及她的舰队
Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.380
一头龙被杀 几艘舰船被击沉
One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed,

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.630
弥桑黛被俘
Missandei captured.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.670
我一直希望着能亲眼目睹他们处决你的姐姐
I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:58.460
看来我是没这个机会了
Seems like I won't get the chance.

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:07.830
他们打算毁掉那座城市
They're going to destroy that city.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.380
你知道他们会的
You know they will.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.750
你打仗的时候逃跑过吗？
Have you ever run away from a fight?

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:17.120
你不像是你姐姐那种人 你不是
You're not like your sister. You're not.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.330
你人比她好多了
You're better than she is.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.960
你是一个好人 而你救不了她
You're a good man and you can't save her.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.960
你没必要和她一起死
You don't need to die with her.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.580
留下来
Stay here.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.790
留下来和我在一起
Stay with me.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.460
求你了
Please.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.540
留下来吧
Stay.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.040
你认为我是个好人？
You think I'm a good man?

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:50.500
为了瑟曦
I pushed a boy out a tower window,

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.670
我把一个男孩从塔楼的窗边推下去
crippled him for life

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:53.750
致使他终身残疾
for Cersei.

01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:59.790
我亲手勒死了自己的堂弟
I strangled my cousin with my own hands

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.920
只是为了能回到瑟曦身边
just to get back to Cersei.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.250
为了瑟曦
I would have murdered

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:11.540
我情愿杀死奔流城里的
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:12.750
每一个男女老少
for Cersei.

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:23.460
她面目可憎
She's hateful.

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.580
我又何尝不是
And so am I.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
<b>格雷果·克里冈
</b>“魔山”

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.630
大人
My lord.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.000
丹妮莉丝女王要求瑟曦无条件投降
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.790
并立即释放纳斯岛的弥桑黛
and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.880
瑟曦女王要求丹妮莉丝无条件投降
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.000
若她拒不从命 纳斯岛的弥桑黛将会被就地正法
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:24.670
科本……
Qyburn...

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.920
你是个理智的人
you're a rational man.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.960
大人 我也是这样自夸的
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.500
我们今日在此有这么一个机会
We have a chance here,

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:37.250
也许是我们最后一次机会来阻止一场杀戮
perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.330
没错
Yes.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.040
帮帮我
Help me.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:45.120
我不忍心看见这城市陷入火海
I don't want to see this city burn.

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:48.500
我不忍心听见孩子们被活活烧死时发出的惨叫
I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.460
是啊 那的确不是什么悦耳的声音
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.830
我——我不想听到那声音
I-- I don't want to hear it.

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:00.330
帮我拯救这座城市
Help me save this city.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.960
大人 我只是我们女王的喉舌而已
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.750
你们女王
Your queen.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.960
瑟曦是七大王国的女王
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.170
而你是她的臣民
You are her subject.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.290
她的统治已终结
Her reign is over.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.920
你明白这一点 你也让她看清这一点
You understand this. Help her understand it.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.540
对于你说的这种事我们一无所知
We understand nothing of the sort.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.420
你们女王的最后一条龙不堪一击
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.420
你们的军队疲惫倦怠 还有些厌战
Your armies are battle-weary and depleted,

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.790
而我们的军队则有黄金团的有力增援——
while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:47.830
准备！
Ready!

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.960
搭箭！
Nock!

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.040
拉弓！
Draw!

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:02.170
我知道你不在乎你的人民
I know you don't care about your people.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.920
你为什么要在乎他们呢？
Why should you?

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.000
你们彼此憎恶
They hate you and you hate them.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.960
但你不是一个怪物
But you're not a monster.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.210
我明白这一点
I know this.

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.170
我曾亲眼目睹过 所以我明白这一点
I know this because I've seen it.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.500
你曾经一直深爱着自己的孩子
You've always loved your children.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.000
胜过爱自己
More than yourself,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.460
胜过爱詹姆
more than Jaime...

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:43.710
胜过这世间一切
more than anything.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:48.330
我求你
I beg you.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.000
如果不是为你自己 这也是为你的孩子着想
If not for yourself, then for your child.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.080
你的统治已终结
Your reign is over,

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.170
但这并不意味着你的生命必须结束
but that doesn't mean your life has to end.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.920
这并不意味着你的孩子必须死
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:15:00.420
如果你还有什么遗言 现在就说
If you have any last words, now is the time.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:26.460
龙焰
Dracarys.

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:37.290
不
